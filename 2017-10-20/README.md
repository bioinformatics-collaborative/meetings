## Meeting w/ Edgar about club creation
_Date: October 20th, 2017
Time: 12 pm_

Rob Gilmore and Shaurita Hutchins met with Edgar Meyer to discuss the intricacies of forming a club or group at UMMC. His advice is below.

### Edgar's Advice

Edgar advised us on the different angles that are available to us.  We could coordinate a group that brings in speakers and/or coordinate a group that meets to have smaller group discussions about Bioinformatics topics, research, or projects.

Currently, we'd like to do both but start with the small group sessions.

#### Holding a seminar for the Bioinformatics Journal Club
1. Recruit people (internal or external) to present & decide on seminar topics
	- Ask advisors for suggestions
	- Create catchy names for the seminars
	- [Ben Pharr](mailto:bnpharr@olemiss.edu) - Interim Director of the MCSR
	- Seminar about HIPPA compliance in regards to data science and working with data
        - Contact [Amanitare Bailey](mailto:azbailey@umc.edu) - Center for Bioethics and Medical Humanities
            - They have a ton of funding.
2. Find a funding source in order to provide food to increase turnout for seminars
    - Ask Department Heads like Dr. Hester, Dr. Stockmeier, and Dr. Griswold about funding
    - Contact [Dr. Natalie Gaughf](mailto:nwgaughf1@umc.edu) about funding
    - Try to avoid pizza; consider Schlotzsky's and other places that deliver.
3. Contact [Leigh A Massey](mailto:lmassey@umc.edu) about reserving a room for a seminar - **refer to her as Mrs. Wallace**
    - Check the UMMC calendar to ensure there isn't too much going on

    - Attempt to reserve R153, R354, 3A, 6A (in that order)
4. Contact [Bruce Coleman](mailto:bcoleman@umc.edu) about using the logo/flyer for the seminar on the scrolling screen saver
5. Create another outlook group for people who may be interested in the seminars.

    - He will attach our names to the email as well as the flyer.
