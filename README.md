# 2017-10-20-Meeting
Rob Gilmore and Shaurita Hutchins met with Edgar Meyer to discuss the intricacies of forming a club or group at UMMC.

# Our Discussion and Ideas

Edgar advised us on the different angles that are available to us.  Basically we could coordiante a group that brings in speakers, and/or we could coordinate a group that meets up to have smaller group discussions about projects or research.

Our idea is to do both, but start with the small group sessions.
